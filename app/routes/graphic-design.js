            "challenge": "This is a print flyer advertisement that introduces the new “Moonlander” bicycle and highlights some of its specialized features. This is designed for a fictitious company the designs specialized bicycles. The goal of this ad was to incorporate rugged graphical aesthetics, to not create something that looks like an advertisement, and to make it feel more like a piece of graphic art.",
            "solution": "The strategy was to focus on illustrating that the Moonlander bike was simply rugged, and meant to be ridden on rough, rocky, sharp, muddy, and wet terrain. I felt the use of rough textures, graphical elements that suggested movement and monochromatic earthy tones would tie really well into the “rugged” theme. I knew there had to be sharp diagonal lines and angles to provide a sense of movement that one would associate with riding a bike. Equally, I wanted to provide a rough, and rocky background texture to bring in the element of using the bike on a bumpy moon-like terrain. Lastly, I wanted to challenge myself by prominently featuring a color that I typically wouldn’t use; this led me to a dark, and earthy shade of brown that a viewer can safely associate with a muddy and dirty terrain. To contrast with that, I used a cold shade of gray to invoke the idea of the moon. As a whole I wanted to craft something that was mostly devoid of color so that it would draw the eye to all the texture and angles."

            "challenge": "The challenge was to create a subway poster that garnered interest, conveyed a rich history, presented an elegant but authentic cultural aesthetic and invited the tourists to visit the Musee d'Orsay in Paris, France. The poster needed to be presented in French, and saturated with the rich history and authenticity of French Art. Equally there needed to be bold yet calming cooler color tones and stylistically appropriate typefaces to match the culture.",
            "solution": "The solution was to architect a design that accurately mimicked the rich historic character and feeling that curious tourists would experience when they visit the museum. Historic character and the foundation for the remainder of the design was created by prominently featuring a warm photograph of the museum; coincidentally this photo also served as its own complex piece of art that was ripe with phenomenal design. To establish a matching color scheme, two colors found within the photo were extracted; to provide a cooler color tone, shades of navy blue were used and to contrast with that, a faint and warm shade of beige was added to provide a faux “paint canvas” texture in the background. Last but not least, I used the French Didot serif typeface to enhance the historic cultural character of the piece. Overall I believe this design served to perpetuate the stereotypical notion that tourists have of French culture, history, and art."

            "challenge": "The challenge was to make the front cover for a trade association membership directory for The Associated Builders and Contractors - Empire State Chapter (New York City). To make things both simple and difficult, no specific design requirements or direction was provided.",
            "solution": "Because this directory was centered around construction, I wanted to maintain a sense of sturdiness and balance throughout the design. I knew there wouldn’t be much content featured on the cover so I anticipated using several images of relevant buildings or construction sites found throughout the city. The final part of the strategy was to use colors that worked well with the red, white, and blue from the logo. To create sturdiness I decided to use a horizontally centered layout with a thick slab serif Rockwell typeface. To grab attention I used a very bright shade of yellow to match the hard hats typically worn at construction sites. Lastly I created a balanced grid that featured three images of construction sites."

            "challenge": "To create the front cover for a governmental study on how to implement a city-wide bicycle plan. This was designed for the city council government of the fictional city of Emerald Grove as well as city residents. The design had to incorporate a simplified yet tasteful version of the table of contents section, feature professional aesthetics, and use a minimal amount of graphics and images.",
            "solution": "The strategy was to first and foremost maintain a professional looking, and minimalist design that tastefully featured bikes. I knew I needed to make the cover stand out in a crowd so I used an enticing full size image of a city bike rack saturated in a deep emerald color. Since biking is an outdoor activity, I kept to an earthy color scheme of green, tan, light yellow and light green. To create a historic vibe, the city name was kept in a minimally transparent serif font and to offset that historic look, I incorporated a few modern sans serif fonts in the document title and table of contents."

            "solution": "The content was purely text, so I experimented with type and layout treatments that I traditionally wouldn’t have had the opportunity to use. To appeal to a younger audience, the color palette was limited to a vibrant and contrasting pair of cyan and pink. To create a light and airy layout, I used five narrow text columns to make the article easier to read. To divide up the individual text sections from each other, any content that wasn’t part of the article body was given a different text and typographic style."

To create a modern approach, the majority of the fonts used are sans serif. To feature an inviting visual element, circular images and mountain shapes were used. "

I layered the ghosted image with an image of music fans that were cheering at a concert to remind the audience of the energy and excitement felt from the music festival. I incorporated bright and colorful text that used colors typically found outdoors during spring and summer time; this was used to remind the audience of the bright outdoor experience during the festival."

This magazine-style guidebook served as a showcase of new homes, builders, remodelers, and residential construction resources from the Spokane Home Builders Association in Washington state. The guidebook was distributed to thousands of individuals who visited the Fall Festival of Homes and in order to fit into the theme of “Fall”, the color scheme had to use earthy and autumnal colors. The content on the cover would consist of multiple logos, and relevant information regarding the time and date of the event. Lastly, the focal point of the cover had to be a home that was showcased in the Fall Festival of Homes.",
            "solution": "To feature and repeat leaves, leaf textures, and autumnal colors that were found within the main logo. Since the photo was a large percentage of the design, I let its colors, shapes, lines and textures grab most of the attention. Because the Northwest region has a lot of newly built modern-looking craftsmen homes, I went with a conservative modern-looking sans serif Century Gothic typeface and contrasted that with the occasional hint of italicized serif text. I feel this simple layout worked to maintain readability, remain bright and eye-catching, while avoiding a cluttered appearance."
